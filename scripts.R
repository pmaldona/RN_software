scr.genrn2 <- function(Nr=100,Ns=Nr) {
  
  # (1) reaction patterns to be used:
  mP <- rbind(c(0,0,0,1,1,50),c(0,0,0,1,2,20),c(0,0,0,2,1,20),c(0,0,0,2,2,10))
  # each pattern is a 6-tuple of species numbers in different roles and weight of the pattern
  # the roles are catalizer, mixed-consumed, mixed-produced, pure-consumed, pure-consumed
  # c(0,0,0,1,1,50) means a reaction with one pure-consumed and one pure-produced species, like a => b
  # c(0,0,0,1,2,50) means a reaction with one pure-consumed and 2 pure-produced species, like a => b + c
  # c(1,1,0,0,0,33) would mean a reaction with one catalyzer and one mixed-consumed species, like a + 2b => a + b
  # each species belonging to a pattern will be a different one when the reaction is generated
  
  # (2) number of reactions to be generated: Nr, a parameter defined by default to be 100
  
  # (3) species (names) to be used:
  S <- paste0("s",1:Ns)
  # S = ["s1","s2","s3",... , "s100"]
  # By default we are using the same number of species as reactions (parameter Ns). Names can be any string.
  # Species are selected at random, many species may not appear in the resulting reaction network.
  
  # (4) cardinalities of species:
  C <- 1:3
  # C = [1,2,3], here these three values are the only ones available for the generation of reactions
  # so s1 => 3s2 (cardinalities 1 an 3) can be generated, but not 5s1 => 4s2 (cardinalities 5 and 4).
  # If there is only one cardinality, mixed species are generated with a second cardinality adding 1.
  # Non integer positive cardinalities can also be used.
  
  # (5) pattern generation function:
  P <- function() rg.rsrt(m=mP)
  # the function uses the patterns just defined, it chooses a pattern at random according to weight
  # we need this function to be given as a parameter to the the generating function rg.rn
  
  # (6) distribution of species (D$s) and cardinalities (D$c)
  D <- list(s=length(S)/(1:length(S))+length(S)/5,c=length(C)/(1:length(C)))
  # D$s should be a matrix of dimensions Ns X 5 were each of the five columns represents the weight of the Ns species
  # according to the corresponding role in the same order as defined in the reaction patterns (one column per role).
  # If D$s has fewer than 5 columns, it is completed by repeating the last column. Here we have only a vector,
  # it is interpreted as a column an the matrix is completed as described (all the columns are the same).
  # D$c is a vector with the weigth of each cardinality.
  # Here both D$s and D$c give much more weight to first values than last, s1 will appear much more frequently than
  # s100, and cardinality 1 more than cardinality 3. For D$s it is important to define highly frequent species so that
  # the generated reaction network form a connected unit, specially if there are not many reactions.
  
  # (7) generation of a random network using the defined parameters:
  rn <<- rg.rn(Nr=Nr,S=S,C=C,P=P,D=D)
  # the result rn is created as a global variable that will persist after the end of this script.
  # There is an additional parameter that can be used, rep=T, which indicates that we accept the repeated generation
  # of a reaction (by default rep=F).
  
  # (8) trimming the generated reaction network:
  trn <<- rn.trim(rn)
  # the result trn is created as a global variable that will persist after the end of this script.
  # non reactive species are eliminated as well as obviously transient species (by statical analysis) and the reactions
  # that use them, repeated and null reactions are also eliminated.

  # we add a first pattern with a catalyzer with weight 10, the former first pattern weight is reduced from 50 to 40
  
  # (3) species (names) to be used:
  S <- c(paste0("c",1:2),paste0("s",1:Ns))
  # S = ["c1","c2","s1","s2","s3",... , "s100"], we added species "c1" and "c2" to be used as catalyzers.

  # with the same weight. The second column stands for all the others choices, which is every species but the
